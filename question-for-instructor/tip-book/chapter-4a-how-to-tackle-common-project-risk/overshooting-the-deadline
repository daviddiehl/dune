RISK
We might overshoot the deadline, and fail to deliver a working product.


We want to use the iterative development process to make sure we have a working product at all times.
We want to try to have a week long iteration so that we only miss submitting the work schedule for last week.
Do you have any reactions to this risk mitigation strategy?


Aside from mitigating this risk, what else should we be thinking about as we try to decide what iteration size would be best for our group?


What steps should we make sure are in each iteration?


Can you compare and contrast waterfall development with iterative?
